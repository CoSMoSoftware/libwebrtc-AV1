# AV1 Integration to libwebrtc

This was a fork of webrtc, by CoSMo software,
specifically for AV1 integration
created early 2020.
The original code is still available in the `backup` branch,
but a much better implementation has now (m90) landed into libwebrtc and Chrome upstream, making this code obsolete.

This repository has still valuable information in its wiki section about
- Example and tests native and web applications, 
- A simple but complete AV1 SVC capable SFU,
- End-to-End testing using KITE,
- All unit tests and KITE tests for a given paragraph in the AV1 RTP Payload Specification for those who want to look at [webrtc.org](https://webrtc.org) unit tests with a fine grain.

For more information on this fork, please see the [wiki section](https://github.com/CoSMoSoftware/libwebrtc-AV1/wiki).
